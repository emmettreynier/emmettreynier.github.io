# What we are going to do...

1. Create a .hi-pink[spatial equilibrium model] of US labor markets  

  - Heterogeneous HH's choose **where to live** and **energy consumption**  
  - Climate impacts energy demand and city's amenity value  
  
--

2. Structurally .hi-pink[estimate the model]     

  - Household data from the census and ACS  
  - Historical climate data from PRISM  

--

3. Simulate .hi-pink[counterfactual climate] scenarios  

  - To-date, climate damages are **3x larger** for black vs white HH's  
  - Black-white gap will **continue to grow** under emissions projections   

---

# Model Overview 
.footnote[.white[(without equations!)]]


---
# Main ingredients  


Households choose .hi-pink[where to live] based on...  
- Wages they could earn  
- Rent they would have to pay  
- Local amenities---includes both climate and non-climate factors   
- Moving costs 

--

Conditional on location, they choose .hi-pink[electricity, gas, and housing demand]  
- They use housing, electricity, and gas to produce **comfort**    
- The comfort production function is **affected by climate**
- Allow for heterogeneity in comfort production technology across demographic groups  

--

Wages and rents **endogenously adjust** based on a city's population.  


---
# Key intuition  

### Suppose there are more hot days in the South... 

--

- **Amenities in the South decrease** relative to other locations  
- **More costly to produce comfort** as HH's use A/C more intensely     

--

$\implies$ conditional on living in the South, utility has decreased.  

--

- Some households **migrate**, equilibrium wages and rents adjust    

--

### Three mechanisms causing .pink[unequal distribution]  

For minority and low-income HH's...

1. **Comfort costs are higher**, use larger share of income for energy  
--

1. **Moving costs are higher**, more difficult migrate to mitigate welfare loss  
--

1. **Greater exposure to climate change** based on *ex-ante* location

# Data and Estimation 


### We structurally estimate the model using... 

1. **Household Data**: Repeated cross sections of the 1990 and 2000 census and 2010 and 2019 5-year ACS   
2. **Climate Data**: Daily temperature and precipitation on a 4km grid of continental US from PRISM
3. **Energy Prices**: Annual, state average residential electricity and gas prices from the EIA  


???

### Brief estimation overview  

1. **Comfort Production Function**: Estimate parameters of comfort production function using relative electricity, gas, and housing demand.    
2. **Moving Costs and Mean Utilities**: Use maximum likelihood estimation targetting the share of demographic group choosing each city.
3. **Climate Amenities**: Decompose mean utilities with OLS.

# Effect of climate change to-date

### Compare present day climate with that of 1990

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs-climate/model/general-eqm/cv_all_1990_2019.jpeg")
```

- Welfare loss for median black HH **3x larger** than median white HH  
- This amounts to damages of $1,200 vs $400 (or 3% vs 1% of income)

---
# Conclusions and next steps 

### Black HH have faced 3x larger climate damages to-date   

- Ability to migrate reduces gap by 33% for white HH, only 14% for black  
- Controlling for initial location reduces the gap by 25% 

--

### Next Steps

- What policies would be effective at .hi-pink[reducing the observed inequalities] in the impact of climate change?  
- Account for natural disaster risk and other extreme weather events  
- Endogenize electricity and gas prices to climate and energy demand

# Household preferences   

Household $i$ of demographic group $d$ living in city $j$ gets utility from a composite $X$, "comfort at dwelling" $\mathcal{C}$, and location-specific amenities $\mathbb{A}$. 

$$U_{ij} = X^{\alpha_d^X} \mathcal{C}_{dj}^{\alpha_d^c}\exp(\mathbb{A}_{ij})$$  
--

**Amenities** are affected by .hi-yellow[climate variables], .hi-green[moving costs], a shared, unobservable component, and an idiosyncratic taste shock

$$\mathbb{A}_{ij} = \color{#FFCC77}{\alpha^Z_d \cdot Z_{j}} +\color{#57754D}{g(j,\boldsymbol{b}_i)}+ \xi_{dj}  + \sigma_d\varepsilon_{ij}.$$

# Household comfort

Households produce .hi-blue[comfort] using .hi-purple[energy] $\color{#9370DB}{\mathcal{E}}$ and housing $H$ 

$$\color{#4682B4}{\mathcal{C}(H,\mathcal{E}|d,j)} = \left(\theta^H_{dj}H^{\rho_c} + \theta^\mathcal{E}_{dj}\color{#9370DB}{\mathcal{E}}^{\rho_c} \right)^{1/\rho_c}$$

.hi-purple[Energy] $\color{#9370DB}{\mathcal{E}}$ aggregates .hi-yellow[electricity] $\color{#FFCC77}{E}$ and .hi-green[natural gas] $\color{#57754D}{G}$.
 
$$\color{#9370DB}{\mathcal{E}(E,G|d,j)} = \left(\theta^E_{dj} \color{#FFCC77}{E}^{\rho_\mathcal{E}} + \theta^G_{dj}\color{#57754D}{G}^{\rho_\mathcal{E}} \right)^{1/\rho_\mathcal{E}}$$
--

**Climate impacts the production of .hi-blue[comfort]** through $\theta^m_{dj}$, where $\theta^m_{dj} = f_m(Z_j)$ for $m \in \{E,G\}$, where $Z_j$ is a vector of climate variables in city $j$.

# Household comfort   

We can simplify the household's problem by .hi-pink[solving two, nested cost-minimization problems]. First for the production of energy using electricity and gas .smallest[[[details]](#energy-cost-min-details)]

$$\min_{E,G} P^E_jE + P^G_jG \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \bar{\mathcal{E}} = \left(\theta^E_{dj} E^{\rho_\mathcal{E}} + \theta^G_{dj}G^{\rho_\mathcal{E}} \right)^{1/\rho_\mathcal{E}}$$

--

The unit cost function gives the **price of energy**   

$$P^\mathcal{E}_{dj} = \left({\theta^E_{dj}}^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}}{P^E_j}^{1-\sigma_\mathcal{E}} + {\theta^G_{dj}}^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}}{P^G_j}^{1-\sigma_\mathcal{E}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma_\mathcal{E}}}$$

Where $\sigma_\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{1-\rho_\mathcal{E}}$ is the elasticity of substitution for electricity and gas.

--

The first-order conditions give us the following conditional demand functions for electricity $E^*$ and natural gas $G^*$, 

$$E^*(\mathcal{E}| d, j) = M^\mathcal{E}_{dj}\left(P^G_{dj}\theta^E_{dj}\right)^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}} \mathcal{E} \qquad
    G^*(\mathcal{E}| d, j) = M^\mathcal{E}_{dj}\left(P^E_j\theta^G_{dj}\right)^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}} \mathcal{E}$$

where $M^\mathcal{E}_{dj} = \left( {\theta^E_{dj}}^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}}{P^G_{dj}}^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}-1} + {\theta^G_{dj}}^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}}{P^E_{dj}}^{\sigma_\mathcal{E}-1}\right)^{\frac{\sigma_\mathcal{E}}{1-\sigma_\mathcal{E}}}$.

The unit cost function gives the **price of comfort**

Where $\sigma_c = \frac{1}{1-\rho_c}$ is the elasticity of substitution for housing and energy.

The first-order conditions give us the following conditional demand functions for energy $\mathcal{E}^*$ and housing $H^*$, 

$$H^*(C| d, j) = M^c_{dj}\left(P^\mathcal{E}_{dj}\right)^{\sigma_c} \mathcal{C}_{dj} \qquad

Again, the unit cost function gives the "price of comfort"

# Estimation overview 

There are a lot of things, today we'll focus on .hi-pink[estimation of comfort]  

--

1. **Comfort parameters** *(Price of comfort)*: Relative demand functions   
2. **Labor supply** *(Moving costs, climate amenities)*: Two-step BLP    
3. **Labor demand** *(College and non-college wages)*: Calibrated .smallest[(Card 2010)]   
4. **Housing supply** *(Elasticity of housing supply, city intercepts)*: Elasticities calibrated, then back out the intercepts .smallest[(Saiz 2010)]

# Estimation strategy for $\mathcal{E}$  

The relative demand function from the cost-minimization problem give us  

$$\log\left({\frac{E_{djt}}{G_{djt}}}\right) = \sigma_\mathcal{E} \log\left({\frac{\theta^E_{djt}}{\theta^G_{djt}}}\right)+ \sigma_\mathcal{E}\log\left(\frac{P^G_{jt}}{P^E_{jt}}\right)$$

--

Taking first differences yields our estimating equation:

$$\Delta \log\left({\frac{E_{djt}}{G_{djt}}}\right) = \sigma_\mathcal{E}\Delta \log\left(\frac{P^G_{jt}}{P^E_{jt}}\right) + \Delta u_{djt}$$  

--

- Concerned with endogeneity between prices and quantity demanded
- Instrument for price ratio with lagged commercial elec and gas prices to isolate shocks to supply .smallest[(working on better instruments)]

--

Use $\hat{\sigma_\mathcal{E}}$ and residuals to calculate $\mathcal{E}$ and $P_\mathcal{E}$


---
# Estimation strategy for $\mathcal{C}$  

The relative demand function from the cost-minimization problem give us  

$$\log\left({\frac{\mathcal{E}_{djt}}{H_{djt}}}\right) = \sigma_c \log\left({\frac{\theta^\mathcal{E}_{djt}}{\theta^H_{djt}}}\right)+ \sigma_c\log\left(\frac{P^H_{jt}}{P^\mathcal{E}_{jt}}\right)$$

--

Taking first differences yields our estimating equation, 

$$\Delta\log\left({\frac{\mathcal{E}_{djt}}{H_{djt}}}\right) = \sigma_{\mathcal{C}}\Delta\log\left(\frac{P^H_{jt}}{P^\mathcal{E}_{jt}}\right) + \Delta\epsilon_{djt}$$

--

We use a **Bartik instrument interacted with land availability** for $\Delta\log(P^H_{jt}/P^\mathcal{E}_{jt})$, taking care of endogeneity caused by unobserved amenities being correlated with both rent and housing demand.


---
# Effect of climate on comfort production  

We parameterize $\theta$'s using $D_{\tau jt}$, the number of days at temperature $\tau$:  

$$\color{#FFCC77}{\log{\tilde{\theta}^E_{djt}}} = \sum_\tau\kappa_E(\tau)D_{\tau jt} + \nu^E_{djt} \qquad \color{#57754D}{\log{\tilde{\theta}^G_{djt}}} = \sum_\tau\kappa_G(\tau)D_{\tau jt} + \nu^G_{djt}$$


- Using some tricky normalizations and the previous estimation, we have estimates of 
$\log{\tilde{\theta}^G_{djt}}$ and $\log{\tilde{\theta}^E_{djt}}$  
- $\kappa_m(\tau)$ is a cubic B-spline, allowing for flexible, non-linear estimate of the effect of an additional day at temperature $\tau$ on electricity and gas demand   
- Identification comes from random variation in weather, as we include city and demographic  group fixed effects  

---
# Estimating labor supply  

We use two steps to estimate the remaining utility parameters

1. **Use BLP to estimate moving cost parameters and "mean utilities"**  
  - Mean utility, $\delta_{djt}$, captures things that affect utility that are constant within demographic group, city, and year, including wages, the price of comfort, and climate amenities.  
  - Have a likelihood function for household choosing each city  
  - Estimate $\delta_{djt}$'s and effect of individual factors using MLE  
--

2. **Decompose the mean utilities to estimate climate amenities**    
  - Calibrate coefficient on wages using Diamond (2016)  
  - Calibrate coefficient on comfort price using comfort expenditure share (Cobb-Douglas utility)  
  - Estimate effect of climate on the residual deltas, after subtracting portion coming from wages and comfort prices  


---
# Moving cost parameters  


We parameterize the moving cost function as  
$$g(j, \boldsymbol{b}_i) = \gamma_d^{st} \mathbb{I}\left(j \in b^{st}_i\right) + \gamma_d^{\text{dist}} \phi \left(j,b^{st}_i\right) + \gamma_d^{\text{dist2}} \phi^2\left(j,b^{st}_i\right)$$

--

We find that college HH's have lower moving costs than non-college   
- Non-college get a higher birth-state premium  
- Non-college distance from birthplace penalties generally higher

# Migration reduces welfare loss  

We **fix locations** and take the difference between that and GE welfare.  

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs-climate/model/general-eqm/migration_value_1990_2019.jpeg")
