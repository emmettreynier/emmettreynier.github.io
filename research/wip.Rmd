#### **Perinatal health effects of herbicides: Glyphosate, Roundup, and the rollout of GM crops** with [Ed Rubin](http://edrub.in/) 

The advent of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified (GM) crops led to rapid and widespread use of the herbicide glyphosate throughout US agriculture. In the two decades following GM-seed introduction, the volume of glyphosate used in the US increased by more than 750%. Despite glyphosate’s breadth and scale, science and policy remain unresolved re- garding its effects on human health. To identify the causal effect of glyphosate exposure on perinatal health, we combine (1) county-level variation in glyphosate use driven by (2) the timing of the release of GM technology and (3) differential geographic suitability for GM crops. Our results suggest glyphosate significantly reduces average birth weight and gestational length. We find effects across the birth-weight distribution, but low-weight births experienced the largest reductions. While our estimates may provide lower bounds— they are net of health benefits from reduced exposure to other pesticides—they suggest that glyphosate exposure accounted for 27-45% of the birth-weight decline rural counties experienced in the past twenty years.
