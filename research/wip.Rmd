#### **Perinatal health effects of herbicides: Glyphosate, Roundup, and the rollout of GM crops** with [Ed Rubin](http://edrub.in/) 

The advent of genetically modified (GM) crops quickly led to the widespread use of glyphosate within U.S. agriculture. Since glyphosate's introduction in 1974, policy-makers have debated its effects on human health. However, the scientific literature offers few generalizable studies on this significant technological innovation. Prior research has focused on lab studies on animals or epidemiologic studies of groups with high occupational exposure. Instead, we focus on the population at large. The general population could face exposure to glyphosate through water (runoff) or air (drift). To identify the causal effect of glyphosate exposure on health, we leverage (1) county-level variation in glyphosate use driven by (2) the timing of the release of GM technology for different crops and (3) differential suitability for these crops. Our results for runoff-driven exposure offer an additional dimension---comparing the effects of upstream pesticide applications to the placebo of downstream applications. Our early results suggest that glyphosate has a significant, negative effect on birth weight (in the same county and year), while upstream glyphosate does not affect birth weights. These estimates are likely lower bounds of the actual health consequences of glyphosate, as they are net of health benefits from reduced exposure to other pesticides (and decreased tillage). In addition to estimating the causal effects of glyphosate exposure on the general population, we contribute to a broader discussion on the efficiency and equity of environmental regulation and the challenges of evaluating these regulations.
