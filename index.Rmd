I am a [Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Oregon](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/economics/all/emmetts) in Eugene. I will be joining the [EPA Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water) as an ORISE research fellow fall of 2023. My research interests include environmental, urban, health, and climate economics. Some of my [current projects](research.html) involve measuring the effect of herbicides on human health, quantifying how climate change has differentially impacted disadvantaged communities, and the spatial misallocation caused by current residential solar panel subsidies.  

The summer before I moved to Eugene, I hiked 2,650 miles from the Mexican border to the Canadian border on the Pacific Crest Trail. Since then, I have done a lot of trail running, exploring some of the many miles of trails in the Pacific Northwest. See my [bio](about.html) for more! See the header or my [CV](cv.html) for contact info.
