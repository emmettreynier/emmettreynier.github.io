Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford's Center on Food Security and the Environment](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/). I recently finished my [Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Oregon](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/economics/all/emmetts) and formerly was an ORISE Research Fellow with the [US EPA Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water).

My research interests include environmental, urban, health, and climate economics. Some of my [current projects](research.html) involve quantifying how climate change has differentially impacted disadvantaged communities, measuring the effect of pesticides on human health, and how to better target subsidies for residential solar.  

I will join the [University of Georgia's Department of Economics](https://www.terry.uga.edu/departments/economics/) as an Assistant Professor Fall of 2026.

I like to run in my leisure time---I currently race for the [Peninsula Distance Club](https://www.peninsuladistanceclub.com/), and have previously been a part of the [Georgetown Running Club](https://www.grcrunning.com/emmett-reynier/) while in DC and the [UO Running Club](https://www.uorunning.com/records.php) in Eugene.
