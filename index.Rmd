Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford's Center on Food Security and the Environment](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/). I recently finished my [Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Oregon](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/economics/all/emmetts) and formerly was an ORISE Research Fellow with the [US EPA Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water).  

My research interests include environmental, urban, health, and climate economics. Some of my [current projects](research.html) involve quantifying how climate change has differentially impacted disadvantaged communities, measuring the effect of pesticides on human health, and how to better target subsidies for residential solar. Here are links to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7_kNOEsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-5622) pages. 
See the header or my [CV](cv.html) for more contact info. 

I will join the [University of Georgia's Department of Economics](https://www.terry.uga.edu/departments/economics/) as an Assistant Professor Fall of 2026.

I like to run in my leisure time---I currently race for the [Peninsula Distance Club](https://www.peninsuladistanceclub.com/), and have previously been a part of the [Georgetown Running Club](https://www.grcrunning.com/emmett-reynier/) while in DC and the [UO Running Club](https://www.uorunning.com/records.php) in Eugene.
