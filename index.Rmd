I am a [Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Oregon](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/economics/all/emmetts) and an ORISE Research Fellow with the [US EPA Office of Water](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water). My research interests include environmental, urban, health, and climate economics. Some of my [current projects](research.html) involve quantifying how climate change has differentially impacted disadvantaged communities, measuring the effect of herbicides on human health, and how to better target subsidies for residential solar. See the header or my [CV](cv.html) for contact info. 

I am on the 2024-2025 job market.  

I like to run in my leisure time---I've been racing with the [Georgetown Running Club](https://www.grcrunning.com/emmett-reynier/) while in DC and the [UO Running Club](https://www.uorunning.com/records.php) in Eugene. 

I recently got married and changed my last name from Saulnier to Reynier.
