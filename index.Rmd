I am an [Economics Ph.D. student at the University of Oregon](https://economics.uoregon.edu/profile/emmetts/) in Eugene. My research interests include environmental, urban, health, and climate economics. Some of my [current projects](research.html) involve measuring the effect of herbicides on human health, quantifying how climate change has differentially impacted disadvantaged communities, and how state taxes impact migration.  

The summer before I moved to Eugene, I hiked 2,650 miles from the Mexican border to the Canadian border on the Pacific Crest Trail. Since then, I have done a lot of trail running, exploring some of the many miles of trails in the Pacific Northwest. See my [bio](about.html) for more!
